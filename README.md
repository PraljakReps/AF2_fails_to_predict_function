# AF2_fails_to_predict_function
Here, we show AF2 multimeric predictions that shows confidence from AF2 doesn't correlate with in vivo function (relative enrichment scores) from the osmosensing assay and Sho1-SH3 system.


#### Figure caption
AlphaFold2's multimeric structural predictions do not correlate with protein function. Despite very high confidence predictions (pLDDT $>$ 90\%), many designed variants show no functional enrichment (r.e. $\leq$ 0, left of dotted line), yielding a false positive rate of 51.97\%. While the wild-type (WT, red) exhibits both high confidence and function (r.e. $\approx$ 1.0), designed variants (black) demonstrate that structural prediction confidence fails to predict functionality. Structural representations show: (i) experimentally solved Sho1$^{SH3}$ domain with pb2 peptide (grey cartoon with yellow sticks), and (ii) AlphaFold2's multimeric predictions (red and blue cartoons with yellow stick ligands).
